For Regression Model: Used Car Price Prediction Project

Project Overview:
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using a machine learning model. The objective is to build a reliable and accurate regression model that can assist both buyers and sellers in estimating a fair market value based on a car's characteristics.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

Practice-AI-ML-Projects-aziro-fresher-: This is the main project folder.

used_car_price_prediction.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data cleaning, EDA, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

used_cars_data.csv: The dataset used for the project.

best_model.pkl: The final trained model, saved as a pickle file for future use.

Key Project Steps
Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and extracted numerical data from columns with mixed data types.

Feature Engineering: Created the car_age feature from the year column to capture the effect of depreciation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (selling_price) and the relationship between different features and the price.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained and compared several regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, SVR, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The models were evaluated using R-squared (R 
2
 ), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Model Selection: Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and saved it for deployment.

Results and Conclusion
The Random Forest Regressor proved to be the most effective model, achieving a Test RÂ² score of 0.931. This indicates that the model can explain over 93% of the variance in the used car prices. The model's strong performance can be attributed to its ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships within the data, which simpler linear models could not.

How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/amogh-aziro-18/Practice-AI-ML-Projects-aziro-fresher-.git
cd Practice-AI-ML-Projects-aziro-fresher-
Install the required packages. The core libraries used are pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, and joblib.

Bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost joblib
Open the used_car_price_prediction.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment (like JupyterLab or Google Colab) and run the cells sequentially to reproduce the entire analysis.
